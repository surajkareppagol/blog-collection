What is Cron? `Cron` is a command line program/utility that is used to schedule
jobs. Along with this Cron is also a job scheduler/task scheduler. It helps to
automate the process of executing tasks repeatedly. The jobs are the tasks which
are other programs or shell commands.

For example, if a user wants to automate the process of updating his/her laptop
with `apt update && apt upgrade`, they can do it via cron. Cron is very flexible
the tasks could be scheduled in terms of _minutes, hours, days, weeks, months
and years_. For example, update the laptop every day on 12:00.

Cron is most suitable for scheduling repetitive tasks.

> Cron's name originates from `Chronos`, the Greek word for time.

== 🤔 How to use it?

Cron works via a configuration file called as `Crontab` (Cron Table). This
configuration file specifies the shell commands that needs to be scheduled.

Each line of a `Crontab` file represents a job. Here is an example of config
file from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[Wikipedia].

[source, sh]
----
# * * * * * <command to execute>
# | | | | |
# | | | | day of the week (0–6) (Sunday to Saturday; 
# | | | month (1–12)             7 is also Sunday on some systems)
# | | day of the month (1–31)
# | hour (0–23)
# minute (0–59)
----

* `*` - Represents minute (0 - 59)
* `*` - Represents hour (0 - 23)
* `*` - Represents day of the month (1 - 31)
* `*` - Represents month (1 - 12)
* `*` - Represents the day of the week (0 - 6), Sunday to Saturday

The syntax for cron-expression excepts five fields, which describe the time and
date and followed by the shell command.

For example, assuming that default shell for the user is `Bash`, this below
cron-expression will _execute the command `echo` at *12:10* every day_.

[source, sh]
----
10 12 * * * echo "Terminal"
----

A much complex example would be something like this,

[source, sh]
----
10 12 2 2 * cal
----

The above cron-expression will _execute the command `cal`, after every second
month, second day of the month, at *12:10*_.

The below command is used to edit the user configuration file regardless of
where the file is stored.

[source, sh]
----
crontab -e
----
