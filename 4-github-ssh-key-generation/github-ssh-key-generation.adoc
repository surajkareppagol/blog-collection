= 🐙 GitHub - SSH Key Generation
:source-highlighter: rouge
:nofooter:

Password authentication was removed from GitHub on August 13, 2021. Instead of
that users now need to use PAT(Personal Access Token) instead. `SSH
(Secure Shell Protocol)`. These tokens are used instead of passwords. For a new
user using SSH tokens may be overwhelming, GitHub has a detailed blog: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent[Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent].

== 🔐 How to generate the SSH token?

What is SSH?

> The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for
> operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most
> notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.

Before generating the token the following packages needs to be installed on the
system.

[source, sh]
----
sudo apt install ssh
sudo apt install openssh-client
sudo apt install openssh-server
----

After installing these packages open the terminal and execute the following
command.

[source, sh]
----
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
----

This command generates the SSH token on the local machine with the provided
email as label.

[source, sh]
----
> Generating public/private ALGORITHM key pair.

> Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM):[Press enter]
----

On this prompt press enter as this will create the file at the default location.

[source, sh]
----
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
----

Enter your secret passphrase, remember twice. This is the first stage of SSH
key setup. Once key is generated it needs to be added to a ssh-agent. But why?

----
If your key has a passphrase and you don't want to enter the passphrase every
time you use the key, you can add your key to the `SSH agent`. The SSH agent
manages your SSH keys and remembers your passphrase.
----

The `SSH agent` is started using the following command. This command will return
the `pid`.

[source, sh]
----
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
----

Once the `SSH agent` is started, the ssh key is added using the following
command. This command prompts for the passphrase that was used during ssh key
generation, enter that passphrase.

[source, sh]
----
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
----

== 🔑 Adding SSH key to GitHub account

Generated SSH key gen could be added to GitHub account. But what key to add?
Remember SSH has private and public keys. The local machine contains the private
key, that only the machine on which it was generated knows and for
authentication the public key needs to be added to the GitHub account.

The following command displays the public key. Copy the text that appears after
this command, don't copy any whitespace after the end.

[source, sh]
----
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
----

Once the key is copied, go to GitHub and follow the steps as mentioned,

* Open settings and click on `SSH and GPG Keys` option.
* Click on `New SSH key` or `Add SSH Key`.
* Add title, it should be descriptive, like local machine etc.
* Paste the copied SSH public key and click on `Add SSH Key`.

Once these steps are completed the process of generating and adding new ssh key
to the GitHub account is done.

== ✅ How to use it?

When cloning the repository make sure to select the `SSH` and not `HTTPS`.
`HTTPS` link starts with `https://github.com` and `SSH` link starts with
`git@github.com:`.

[source, sh]
----
git clone git@github.com:github/github.git
----

It will prompt for the SSH passphrase which was used when generating the ssh
keys.

== 🚀 Conclusion

This is a quick guide into how to generate and add the SSH key to GitHub
account. The same generated key could be used for other services such as`GitLab`
and others.
