What is `Game of Life`? In simpler words Game of Life is a model of
computation. A model of computation describes how a output value to be
calculated given an input.

Game of Life is also called as `Conway's Game of Life`, as it was _invented by
the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970_.

== üëæ Rules of Game of Life

Game of Life is a *zero player* game, meaning that it depends only on the
initial state or configuration without needing any further inputs. Game of Life
has a environment called as universe. It is an infinite, two dimensional
orthogonal grid of square `cells`. Each cell could be one of the two possible
states, live or dead (On or Off).

As the game proceeds _every cell interacts with its eight neighbor cells_. These
are cells which are immediately attached to the original cell. Each interaction
results in one of these transitions:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by
under-population.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by
reproduction.

The initial configuration or pattern is the `seed` of the system. New
generations of cells are created by applying the above rules to each and every
cell. The discrete movement in which it occurs is called as `tick`.

== üë®‚Äçüíª Programming Game of Life in C Language

The below program is the implementation of Game of Life in C Language.

NOTE: The implementation is from https://rosettacode.org[Rosetta code].

The values `width` and `height` are essential, as these values will decide the
universe size.

[source, c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void show(void *universe_pre, int width, int height);
void evolve(void *universe_pre, int width, int height);
void game(int width, int height);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int width = 0, height = 0;

  if (argc > 1) {
    width = atoi(argv[1]);
  }

  if (argc > 2) {
    height = atoi(argv[2]);
  }

  if (width <= 0) {
    width = 30;
  }

  if (height <= 0) {
    height = 30;
  }

  game(width, height);

  return 0;
}
----

The `game()` function will do the initial configuration and will call the
`evolve()` function continuously.

[source, c]
----
void game(int width, int height) {
  unsigned universe[height][width];

  for (int i = 0; i < width; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < height; j++) {
      /* Initial configuration */
      universe[j][i] = rand() < RAND_MAX / 10 ? 1 : 0;
    }
  }

  while (1) {
    show(universe, width, height);
    evolve(universe, width, height);
    usleep(200000);
  }
}
----

The `show()` function loops over the universe and displays the status of each
cell, that is live or dead. For this implementation ANSI escape sequences are
being used.

[source, c]
----
void show(void *universe_pre, int width, int height) {
  int(*universe)[width] = universe_pre;

  printf("\033[H");

  for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
      printf(universe[i][j] ? "\033[07m \033[m" : "  ");
    }

    printf("\033[E");
  }

  fflush(stdout);
}
----

The `evolve()` function is responsible for generating the next generation of
cells based on the previous generation. Although this is a minimal implementation
of `Game of Life`, there are many variations.

[source, c]
----
void evolve(void *universe_pre, int width, int height) {
  unsigned(*universe)[width] = universe_pre;
  unsigned universe_next[height][width];

  for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
      int steps = 0;

      for (int x = i - 1; x <= i + 1; x++) {
        for (int y = j - 1; y <= j + 1; y++) {
          if (universe[(x + height) % height][(y + width) % width]) {
            steps++;
          }
        }
      }

      if (universe[i][j]) {
        steps--;
      }

      universe_next[i][j] = (steps == 3 || (steps == 2 && universe[i][j]));
    }
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
      universe[i][j] = universe_next[i][j];
    }
  }
}
