`Clear` command is one of the most used command. The description of `Clear`
command from the `man page`,

[quote, clear]
----
clear clears your terminal's screen and its scrollback buffer, if any. clear
retrieves the terminal type from the environment variable TERM, then consults
the terminfo terminal capability database entry for that type to determine how
to perform these actions.

This command can be implemented in *two* ways!

== Using `newlines` escape sequence!

This method uses `newline` escape sequence to clear the screen. This behavior
is similar to `CTRL + L` keybinding.

But how many newline characters? The answer depends on the terminal window size.
If the total rows are _20_, then _20 + 20_ newline characters. The terminal size
can be obtained easily using libraries such as ncurses. But here let's use
`winsize` structure from `unistd.h` as explained in this 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1022957/getting-terminal-width-in-c[stackoverflow] page.

[source, c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main (int argc, char **argv)
{
    struct winsize w;
    ioctl(STDOUT_FILENO, TIOCGWINSZ, &w);

    for (int i = 0; i < w.ws_row + 10; i++) {
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
----

Here `winsize` has two members `ws_row` and `ws_col`. After the `ioctl` call
this structure is populated with row and column values.

Once the number of rows are available just loop over and print newline
characters.

== Using `ANSI` escape sequence

Yes, `\n` was a escape sequence but there are other escape sequences which are
available for the terminal manipulation. One such escape sequence that could be
used to clear the screen is `ESC[2J`. Here `ESC` is the escape sequence code
which could be `\033` or \0x1B`.

[source, c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("\033[2J");
    return 0;
}
----

Although this works in `Gnome Terminal` it might not work in other terminals.
Also the cursor doesn't move back to home location that is `0, 0` to achieve
this one more escape sequence could be used that is `\033[H`.

== Conclusion

Although these two approaches work but these are not portable to all the
terminals. But this gives an idea about the implementation of the `clear` command.
